= Scanty, a really small blog

== Overview

Scanty is blogging software.  Software for Adam Wiggins's blog, to be exact:
http://adam.blog.heroku.com

It is not a blogging engine, but it's small and easy to modify, so it could be
the starting point for your blog, too.

== New Features

The original blogging software by Adam has been extended by Christopher to
support some new features as well:

* Multiple users
* Display names for users
* Salted, hashed passwords for users
* Separate configuration file
* Syntax highlighing for code
    (by alex.gorbatchev: http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/)

== Features

* Posts (shock!)
* Tags
* Markdown (via RDiscount)
* Ruby code syntax highlighting (via Syntax)
* Atom feed
* Comments via Disqus
* Web framework = Sinatra
* ORM = Sequel

== Dependencies

  $ gem install sinatra sequel rdiscount syntax

== Setup

Edit main.rb and change the Blog config struct at the top to your liking.  For
security purposes, change the admin password and the admin cookie key and
value.  These last two can be set to any random value you like, just choose
something other than the default.

Then run the server:

  $ ruby main.rb

And visit: http://localhost:4567/

Log in with the password you selected, then click New Post.  The rest should be
self-explanatory.

In production, you'll probably want to run "rake start" to start (and restart)
the server.  Change the value of "port" at the top of the Rakefile to run on a
different port.

== Database

The default is a SQLite file named blog.db.  To use something else, set
DATABASE_URL in your environment when running the app, i.e.:

  $ DATABASE_URL='mysql://localhost/myblog' ruby main.rb

Or, modify the Sequel.connect statement at the top of main.rb.

The database will be created automatically when the server is executed.

== Comments

There are no comments by default.  If you wish to activate comments, create an
account and a website on Disqus (disqus.com) and enter the website shortname as
the :disqus_shortname value in the Blog config struct.

== Customize

There are no themes or settings beyond the basic ones in the Blog struct.  Just
edit the CSS or the code as you see fit.
